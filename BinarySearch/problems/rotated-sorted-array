--
if element is found - return the index

--
chekcing which part we are in
by
nums[mid]>=nums[0]
then 
got  a clarification that we are in the first increasing part
then
  -- comparing like
     -- target<nums[0] || target>nums[mid] -> move to right = left = mid+1;
      else -- right = mid-1;
--
  --in second increasing part
      --target <nums[n-1] || target<nums[mid] --> move to left ==> right=mid-1;
      else -- left=mid+1;
